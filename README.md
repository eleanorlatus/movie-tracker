Movie Tracker is a simple React application that uses the TMDB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-GB) to return either top rated or recently trending movies.

## Getting started

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Optimisations

For optimisations, I would like to utilise local storage to save the user's liked movies and theme preference. I would also like to add a watchlist feature and a feature that allows users to share recommended movies with their friends.
